# net.sh

`net.sh` is a simple shell script which is build to configure my personal
network on FreeBSD. The script support:

- Ethernet configuration
- Wireless configuration via `wpa_supplicant`
- DNS configuration
- OpenVPN and OpenConnect configuration

It's not a full network manager, it more or less use existing defaults to
configure the network devices on my needs.
